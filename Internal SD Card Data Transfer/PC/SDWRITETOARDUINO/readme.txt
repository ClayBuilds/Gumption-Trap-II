NOTE: WRITING TO ARDUINO WILL ERASE ALL EXISTING CONTENTS OF THE ONBOARD SD CARD. COPY DATA OFF OF IT BEFORE WRITING NEW DATA.

Place a "COORDS.TXT" file in the folder "filestosend". before use. Python script will copy all contents to the onboard SD card.

Close the arduino IDE after "SDWRITETOARDUINO" is uploaded. Power cycle the arduino, then run the python script.
